The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but there's a subtle error that can occur when dealing with units.  If you try to subtract a percentage from a length value directly within the `calc()` function, it can result in unexpected behavior. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 50px);` is valid, but `width: calc(50px - 10%);` might not work as expected in all browsers. The correct approach depends on what you intend to achieve. If the intention is to remove 10% of 50px, then you need to explicitly calculate that value first.
